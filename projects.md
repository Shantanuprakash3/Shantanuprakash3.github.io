Algorithms, Machine intelligence and entreprenership. Fascinated by computing and internet capabilites since I got exposed to programming in college. As my hands got dirtier, started appreciating the beauty of code and systems in the academia and industry. Have grown up reading anything and everything I could lay my hands on.

An incomplete, rough reverse chronological timeline
of what I've been upto:

-----

## 2016 - Present


Throughout college, did a breadth first traversal of Computer Science in general. Explored things and made friends, exercised the newfound liberty a bit. Didn't get "expertise" in anything though, nor a stellar GPA, realized this mistake later.

Working as Engineer in Bangalore for past few years, picking things and learning things in depth all over again.

## 2015
* I spent time carrying out research in multiple topics of computer science as my understanding of fundamentals got better, in my pre final year. Artificial Intelligence, huerestics for application in quantitative finance.
* During this time, I created an [algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7166612/) for solving ANPR using Ant Colony Optimization, co-authoring a paper and presenting results at [IEEE-ICIS Las Vegas 2015](https://dblp.org/db/conf/ACISicis/ACISicis2015). The work explored a new algorithm promising in low/partial light conditions. The Ant colony optimization (ACO) is an optimization algorithm inspired by the natural behavior of ant species that ants deposit pheromone on the ground for foraging. A heurestic ACO based approach introduced, proved a better image edge detection. The work has been [cited](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=rmm0zOgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) multiple times in image processing research in Artificial Intelligence journals.
* In my final year, I joined the [Wearable, Pervasive & Networking Lab](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/WearablePervasiveNetworkingLaboratory) working under the lab head [Dr VS Shekhawat](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/vsshekhawat/profile) researching on Machine Learning applications in Delay Tolerant Networks. I designed a new routing algorithm, promising reduced overhead and improved delivery rate using reinforcement learning, recognising periodic movement patterns of mobile network nodes.
Research [work](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/13QncxCbCXJr0Y) yet to be published.
* I also tried open source development as an applicant to Google Summer of Code, [proposing](https://dragonpunch3.blogspot.com) implementation of new algorithms which support finding intersection points of the various Geometric objects fot the Math app GeoGebra. I sent a few patches that were helpful to the team. Although I didn't make the cut, got mentioned by the [organization](http://dev.geogebra.org/trac/wiki/Gsoc2015). Appreciated the power of open source collaboration in software.

## 2014
* Second year of college, got interested in a fascinating application of algorithms, in quantitative finance. Did a lot of self reading while interning at [Hedge Quants Capital Advisory](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hedge-quants/about/) in Kolkata over the winters. There, I developed & executed quantitative trading strategies which included ideating a breakout inspired algorithm, back-testing on historical data of CNX midcap 100, optimization of parameters, and hence simulation of strategy. 

* Freelanced for a Quant Researcher, Founder of [Qcfinance.in](https://qcfinance.in) helping in research and writing MATLAB code for multiple papers. Thesis validation, 
simulation, setting up graphs and heatmaps. Involved in following studies:

1. Applying Systematic & Rule Based Risk Management for Projected Portfolio (Passive Investment)
2. Literature Review and Open research areas in Risk Modelling for HFT, Algorithms trading and Dark Pools.
3. Game Theory and Corporate Finance Models for
Observing International Business between India and
Israeli Nanotech Companies.

## 2013

* Co-founded adhyayan.co, a project collaboration [portal](https://github.com/Shantanuprakash3/cms) for academicians, with my high school friends. As Indian tech startup ecosystem started gaining momentum, this was our attempt in getting involed. Initial research, [product](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/8WEY8QBTFBJ58A) brainstorming, designed and developed MVP. We entered quite a few [b-plan/startup](https://www.facebook.com/ecell.iitkgp/posts/shortlisted-entries-for-app-ideation-contest1-raviteja4145gmailcom-ges-id-49512-/10152575294578266/) competitions during this time in hopes of raising enough money to pay for servers and marketing, reached finals in a few but couldn't win anything big. We thought we were short on time as 2nd years, and us studying in 4 different universities in different cities didn't help.

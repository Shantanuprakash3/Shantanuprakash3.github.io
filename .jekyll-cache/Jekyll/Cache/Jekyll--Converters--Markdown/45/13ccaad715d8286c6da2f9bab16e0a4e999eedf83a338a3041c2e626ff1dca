<p>I work at <a href="http://trell.co">Trell</a> writing scalable and available distributed systems. 
Trell is Indiaâ€™s largest lifestyle blogging/vlogging app. Iâ€™m making sure our backend 
scales with our growth! I want to use this website to help teach people new skills, 
as I learn them myself.</p>

<p>Before working at Trell, I was with <a href="http://exotel.com">Exotel</a> for three years. A high functioning small team running a quality CPaaS platform, at an availability of 99.95 pc. Serving to businesses in South Asia. I closely worked with sales, product and operations while leading Enterprise Products for the company.</p>

<p>Before that, I earned my engineering degree from <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/ResearchLabs">Department of Computer Science, BITS Pilani</a> studying in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilani">Pilani, Rajashan</a>. The four years in Pilani was probably my most transformative period.
During this period, I befriended a lot of smart folks, survived sub zero winters, discovered jazz &amp; rock, passed a few courses with &lt; 5% attendance, attended Jaipur Literature Fest, unfailingly!</p>

<p>Well, before that, I finished my high school from <a href="http://jvmshyamali.com/">JVM Shyamali</a> in Ranchi. There i spent the first eighteen years in Ranchi cycling to the bookstore, and feasting on samosas on the way back. My negotiating skills can be traced back to the skirmishes of the Great Bickering Sibling Battles of this era.</p>

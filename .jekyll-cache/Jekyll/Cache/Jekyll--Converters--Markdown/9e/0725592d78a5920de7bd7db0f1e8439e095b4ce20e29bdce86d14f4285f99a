<p>I work at <a href="http://trell.co">Trell</a>, writing scalable and available distributed systems. 
Trell is Indiaâ€™s largest lifestyle blogging/vlogging app.</p>

<p>Before working at Trell, I was with <a href="http://exotel.com">Exotel</a> for three years. A high functioning small team running a quality CPaaS platform, at an availability of 99.95 pc, serving businesses in South Asia. I closely worked with sales, product and operations while leading Enterprise Products for the company.</p>

<p>Before that, I earned my engineering degree from <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/ResearchLabs">Department of Computer Science, BITS Pilani</a> studying in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilani">Pilani, Rajashan</a>. And before that, I finished my high school from <a href="http://jvmshyamali.com/">JVM Shyamali</a> in Ranchi.</p>

<p>In Ranchi, I spent the first eighteen years cycling to the bookstore, and feasting on samosas on the way back. My negotiating skills can be traced back to the skirmishes of the Great Bickering Sibling Battles of this era.</p>

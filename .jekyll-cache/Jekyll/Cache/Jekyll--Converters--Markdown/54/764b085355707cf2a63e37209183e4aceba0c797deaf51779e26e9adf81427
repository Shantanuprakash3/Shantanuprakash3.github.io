<p>Thatâ€™s me trying not to fall off the boat. Ha Long Bay, Sep â€˜19.</p>

<p>Living in Bangalore since June 2016. Currently, I work at <a href="http://trell.co">Trell</a>, Indiaâ€™s largest lifestyle blogging/vlogging app. I help make sure weâ€™re ready for scale, and always high performant.</p>

<p>Before working at Trell, I was with <a href="http://exotel.com">Exotel</a> for a little more than 3 years, where i wrote and broke a lot of code, working with few excellent people.</p>

<p>Before that, I went to <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/ResearchLabs">Department of Computer Science, BITS Pilani</a> studying in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilani">Pilani, Rajashan</a>. Most transformative period of my life. 
And before that, I finished my high school from <a href="http://jvmshyamali.com/">JVM Shyamali</a> in <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.in/Tourism-g662320-Ranchi_Ranchi_District_Jharkhand-Vacations.html?fid=dee83ba9-324b-4587-b373-b81513eb49a3">Ranchi</a>.</p>

<p>In Ranchi, I spent majority of eighteen years cycling to the bookstore, and nibbling on <a href="https://www.zomato.com/ranchi/samosa-planet-kadru">samosas</a> on the way back. Growing up with two sisters, my negotiating skills can be traced back to the skirmishes of the Great Bickering Sibling Battles of this era. Growing up in the city, went <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_Westcott_Boys%27_School">here</a> for kindergarten and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAV_Kapil_Dev_Public_School">here</a> for middle school.</p>

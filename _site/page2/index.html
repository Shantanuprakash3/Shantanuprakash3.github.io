    <p>What are some good ways to travel without spending too much? :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not doing tourist-y things while travelling. Try and stay with locals, use public transport, get recommendations from locals about stuff around. It can save you a lot of money, because things that travel plans - packages suggest are almost always costlier. Tourist places (like monuments, museums) and activities rip you off too. And personally, I feel the travel experience is much better too if you go and do as the locals do instead of being herded around by guides!</p>

<p>Two weeks covering New York, Buffalo, San Francisco, Los Angeles AND Las Vegas i spent little above 1100 dollars. 14 days, five cities. This is definitely not a dirt cheap number but we covered much more than what it would normally entail. There were three of us, still in third year of college, attending an IEEE conference presenting our research paper in Vegas. We were students spending Rupees in Dollars, so had to be frugal. But we didn’t want a not-so-fun super-lean trip to the conference, so prior planning and booking had to be done.</p>

<p>Got week or day pass for metro / bus in every city. Airbnb (not in Vegas, of course :P) for stays, carrying few ready to eat meals from home helped a lot. This was a great way to meet locals and chat about things people do there. We took intercity bus rides. And we walked around a lot in the cities. Never took cabs. Sometimes we travelled at night so we don’t have to spend for night stay.</p>

<p>We did cover a lot, many of which can be skipped. We had a brunch in a Michelin starred restaurant, Caught a Yankees game, Stayed in big ass hotels on the Vegas strip. Tried expensive exotic seafood and cheap local beers!</p>

<p>So, yeah, if you plan well, you can do a lot being under your budget!</p>

Living in Bangalore. I work at [Trell](http://trell.co), writing scalable and available distributed systems. 
Trell is India's largest lifestyle blogging/vlogging app. 


Before working at Trell, I was with [Exotel](http://exotel.com) for three years, where i wrote and broke a lot of code, working with few excellent people. 

Before that, I earned my engineering degree from [Department of Computer Science, BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/ResearchLabs) studying in [Pilani, Rajashan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilani). And before that, I finished my high school from [JVM Shyamali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawahar_Vidya_Mandir) in [Ranchi](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Tourism-g662320-Ranchi_Ranchi_District_Jharkhand-Vacations.html?fid=dee83ba9-324b-4587-b373-b81513eb49a3). 

In Ranchi, I spent majority of eighteen years cycling to the bookstore, and nibbling on [samosas]() on the way back. Growing up with two sisters, my negotiating skills can be traced back to the skirmishes of the Great Bickering Sibling Battles of this era.

**Hi! I'm Shantanu.**

That's me trying not to fall off the boat. Ha Long Bay, Sep '19.

Living in Bangalore since June '16. Currently, I work at [Trell](http://trell.co), India's largest lifestyle video blogging app. I help make sure we're ready for scale, and always high performant.


Before working at Trell, I was with [Exotel](http://exotel.com) for a little more than 3 years, where i wrote and broke a lot of code, working with few excellent people. We made sure everyday millions of calls and sms's go with minimal latency and high fault taulerance.

Before that, I went to [Department of Computer Science, BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/ResearchLabs) studying in [Pilani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilani). Was arguably the most transformative period of my life. 
And before that, I finished my high school from [JVM Shyamali](http://jvmshyamali.com/) in [Ranchi](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Tourism-g662320-Ranchi_Ranchi_District_Jharkhand-Vacations.html?fid=dee83ba9-324b-4587-b373-b81513eb49a3). 

In Ranchi, I spent majority of eighteen years cycling to the bookstore, and scrunching on [samosas](https://www.zomato.com/ranchi/samosa-planet-kadru) on the way back. Growing up with two amazing sisters, my negotiating skills can be traced back to the skirmishes of the Great Bickering Battles of '94 - '12. In the city, went [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_Westcott_Boys%27_School) for kindergarten and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAV_Kapil_Dev_Public_School) for middle school.
